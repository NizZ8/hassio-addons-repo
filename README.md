## About
I created this repo to store the addons I use and/or created myself but as some add-ons might come in handy for others too I decided to make the repo public.

## Installation

Adding this add-ons repository to your Hass.io Home Assistant instance is
pretty easy. Follow [the official instructions][third-party-addons] on the
website of Home Assistant, and use the following URL:

## Add-ons provided by this repository

### &#10003; [Playlistsyncer][addon-playlistsyncer]

This addon/docker image will allow you to sync playlists between several streaming services. I created this as a personal project but this might come in handy for others too.

Sonarr (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
